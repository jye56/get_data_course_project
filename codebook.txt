This file explains the content in the tidydata.txt file generated by the script run_analysis.R

This file is created by the line write.table(datasummary,"./tidydata.txt") 
within "run_analysis.R", near the end of the script. 

This table has 180 rows and 88 columns:
 
The first column is the 6 activity levels (1 WALKING/2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS/3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
/4 SITTING/5 STANDING/6 LAYING). 

The second column is subject(subjects 1-30). 

Columns 3-88 are data representing means for different variables (86 variables/columns) 
for each activity and subject combination (180 combinations: 6 levels x 30 subjects). 
These 86 variables are variables with "mean" or "std" in the designation, selected from 561 variables 
in the original X data sets. 
The variables are renamed for the tidydata, adding "meanof" to the beginning of each original variable
by using paste0() function, to reflect that the numerical values n the tidy data set are means of 
either means or standard deviations of the original data.

The 180 rows are the combinations of activity levels and subjects.

This codebook is very brief, mainly for the purpose of practicing tidying up data. I do not understand
the physical or physiological meanings of the data, preventing me from giving more detail description,
such as units and the meanings.vHad I understand the physical meaning of the data, 
my codebook would have been more detailed.
